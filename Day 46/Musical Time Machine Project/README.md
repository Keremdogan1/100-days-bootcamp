The Day 46's original task was creating top 100 songs of "{date}'s" playlist to "Spotify" with data from "Billboard Hot 100"
However, mine project find top 100 songs from "Vikipedia" by "year" and creates a playlist for my own "Youtube Music" profile.

That's the case because of some technical issues. Neighter Spotify and Billboard didn't helped me while making this project.
Billboard wanted a "Premium" and Spotify weren't able to create an "App".

Overall, i finished today's project "somehow" so i think this is not an problem.
