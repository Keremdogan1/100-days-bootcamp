### Day 50 – Automating Tinder Swipes with Selenium

- Built an automated Tinder bot using Selenium WebDriver
- Logged into Tinder via third-party authentication (Facebook/Google)
- Simulated human-like interactions such as swiping right and left
- Handled pop-ups, permission dialogs, and dynamic UI elements
- Used explicit waits to manage asynchronous page loading
- Applied exception handling for missing elements and unexpected UI changes
- Practiced browser automation best practices and understood bot limitations
