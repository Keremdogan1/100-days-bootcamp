### Day 52 – Instagram Follower Bot with Selenium

- Built an automated Instagram bot using Selenium WebDriver
- Automated login process with username and password authentication
- Navigated to a target Instagram account profile programmatically
- Identified and interacted with dynamic web elements (buttons, dialogs, pop-ups)
- Opened the followers list and scrolled dynamically to load more users
- Implemented logic to follow users automatically from the followers list
- Handled common Instagram pop-ups such as notifications and confirmations
- Used explicit waits to ensure elements were fully loaded before interaction
- Managed exceptions for already-followed or restricted accounts
- Reinforced browser automation skills with a real-world social media use case
